==================
Opening (0:00-0:30)
==================

[Scene: Dark hospital corridor. Fluorescent lights flicker creating an unsettling atmosphere]

Narration (Do-hyun's voice): 
"When people sleep, someone must stay awake. 
From today, that someone is... me."

[Title Card: "Night Guardian"]

========================
Scene 1: First Shift Begins (0:30-1:30)
========================

[Scene: St. Mary Hospital security office. Do-hyun adjusts his tie while looking in the mirror, wearing an old uniform]

Do-hyun: (to himself) 
"Kim Do-hyun, you can do this. It's just security work."

[Security office door opens as the previous shift guard, Guard Park, enters]

Guard Park: 
"The replacement is here. You're Kim Do-hyun, right?"

Do-hyun: 
"Yes, hello!"

Guard Park: (with tired expression) 
"First time on night shift? Nothing much. Check CCTV, patrol, lock doors... but."

Do-hyun: 
"Yes?"

Guard Park: (meaningfully) 
"This hospital has some... peculiar things happening at night. Don't dig too deep. You understand?"

[Guard Park leaves while Do-hyun looks confused]

Do-hyun: 
"Peculiar things?"

========================
Scene 2: Emergency Room Commotion (1:30-3:00)
========================

[Scene: Emergency room. Min-ji is organizing charts. Suddenly, ambulance siren sounds]

Min-ji: (into radio) 
"Emergency room, patient incoming!"

[Emergency room doors open as a patient on a stretcher is brought in. The patient is unconscious with strange wounds]

Paramedic: 
"Male in his 30s, unconscious, unknown cause laceration!"

Woo-jin: (running over) 
"What are the vitals?"

Paramedic: 
"Blood pressure 90/60, weak pulse, but the strange thing is..."

Min-ji: (looking at patient in surprise) 
"These wounds... something's odd."

[So-young runs over, breathing heavily]

So-young: 
"Sorry! I'm late!"

Woo-jin: (coldly) 
"Intern, do you know what time it is?"

So-young: 
"I'm sorry, doctor..."

========================
Scene 3: Do-hyun's First Patrol (3:00-4:30)
========================

[Scene: Hospital corridor. Do-hyun walks with a flashlight on patrol]

Do-hyun: (looking at checklist) 
"First floor corridor check, second floor patient room check..."

[Suddenly, strange sounds are heard from somewhere]

Do-hyun: 
"What's that?"

[Following the sound, he arrives near the emergency room. He encounters Min-ji coming out of the emergency room]

Min-ji: (startled) 
"Oh! You scared me. You're the new security guard, right?"

Do-hyun: (awkwardly) 
"Yes, I'm Kim Do-hyun. Did you hear that strange sound just now..."

Min-ji: 
"Oh, it's nothing. Just medical equipment sounds."

[But Min-ji's expression looks anxious]

Do-hyun: 
"Is something wrong...?"

Min-ji: (speaking quickly) 
"Really, it's nothing. Continue your patrol."

[Min-ji hurries back into the emergency room. Do-hyun watches with suspicious eyes]

========================
Scene 4: Suspicious Patient (4:30-5:30)
========================

[Scene: Inside emergency room. Woo-jin is examining the patient]

Woo-jin: (to So-young) 
"First time seeing wounds like this?"

So-young: 
"Yes... it's not a knife cut, not an animal bite..."

Min-ji: (entering) 
"CT results are in."

Woo-jin: (looking at CT in surprise) 
"What is this..."

[All three look at the CT scan in bewilderment]

So-young: 
"Doctor, this isn't normal."

Woo-jin: (seriously) 
"Don't tell anyone. Especially not the security guard."

[Sound of Do-hyun passing by outside. The three become quiet]

Min-ji: (whispering) 
"That guy is suspicious. He walks around too much."

Woo-jin: 
"Be careful. This can't get out."

========================
Scene 5: First Clue (5:30-6:00)
========================

[Scene: Security office. Do-hyun is checking CCTV]

Do-hyun: (looking at monitor) 
"Something's strange..."

[On CCTV screen, a strange shadow passes before the patient arrived]

Do-hyun: 
"What's this?"

[He tries to replay the video but the screen gets noisy]

Do-hyun: 
"Is it broken?"

[Suddenly the security office door opens and Min-ji enters]

Min-ji: 
"Do-hyun, are you okay?"

Do-hyun: (surprised) 
"Yes? Oh, yes. I'm fine."

Min-ji: (intentionally) 
"It's hard on your first day, isn't it? Would you like a cup of coffee?"

Do-hyun: (suspiciously) 
"Thank you, but... why suddenly?"

Min-ji: (smiling) 
"Just because. It's going to be a long night."

[Min-ji leaves with a meaningful smile. Do-hyun becomes more suspicious]

[Cliffhanger: Suddenly the power goes out and the hospital is plunged into darkness]

Do-hyun: 
"What the...?"
